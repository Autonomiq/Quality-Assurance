<p>Artemis 1 was outlined by NASA as Exploration Mission 1 (EM-1) in 2012, at which point it was set to launch in 2017[23][note 2] as the first planned flight of the Space Launch System and the second uncrewed test flight of the Orion Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle. The initial plans for EM-1 called for a circumlunar trajectory during a seven-day mission.[25][26]

In January 2013 it was announced that the Orion spacecraft's service module was to be built by the European Space Agency and named the European Service Module.[27] In mid-November 2014 construction of the SLS core stage began at NASA's Michoud Assembly Facility (MAF).[28] In January 2015 NASA and Lockheed Martin announced that the primary structure in the Orion spacecraft used on Artemis 1 would be up to 25% lighter compared to the previous one (EFT-1). This would be achieved by reducing the number of cone panels from six (EFT-1) to three (EM-1), reducing the total number of welds from 19 to 7[29] and saving the additional mass of the weld material. Other savings would be due to revising its various components and wiring. For Artemis 1, the Orion spacecraft will be outfitted with a complete life support system and crew seats but will be left uncrewed. </p>

<p>Ground testing

First static fire attempt of the core stage performed on January 16, 2021
The core stage for Artemis 1, built at Michoud Assembly Facility by Boeing, had all four engines attached in November 2019[39] and was declared finished one month later.[40] The core stage left the facility to undergo the Green Run test series at Stennis Space Center, consisting of eight tests of increasing complexity:[41]

Modal testing (vibration tests)
Avionics (electronic systems)
Fail-safe systems
Propulsion (without firing of the engines)
Thrust vector control system (moving and rotating engines)
Launch countdown simulation
Wet dress rehearsal, with propellant
Static fire of the engines for eight minutes
The first test was performed in January 2020,[41][42] and subsequent Green Run tests proceeded without issue. On January 16, 2021, a year later, the eighth and final test was performed, but the engines shut down after running for one minute.[43] This was caused by pressure in the hydraulic system used for the engines' thrust vector control system dropping below the limits set for the test. However, the limits were conservative â€“ if such an anomaly occurred in launch, the rocket would still fly normally.[44] The static fire test was performed again on March 18, 2021, this time achieving a full-duration eight-minute burn.[45] The core subsequently departed the Stennis Space Center on April 24, 2021, on route to the Kennedy Space Center.[46]</p>


<p>Assembly

SLS with the Orion capsule in the Vehicle Assembly Building, March 2022
The Interim Cryogenic Propulsion Stage was the first part of the SLS to be delivered to the Kennedy Space Center in July 2017.[47] Three years later, all of the SLS's solid rocket booster segments were shipped by train to the Kennedy Space Center on June 12, 2020,[48] and the SLS launch vehicle stage adapter (LVSA) was delivered by barge one month later on July 29, 2020.[49] The assembly of the SLS took place at the Vehicle Assembly Building's High Bay 3, beginning with the placement of the two bottom solid rocket booster segments on November 23, 2020.[50] Assembly of the boosters was temporarily paused due to the core stage Green Run test delays before being resumed on January 7, 2021,[51] and the boosters' stacking was completed by March 2, 2021.[52]

The SLS core stage for the mission, CS-1, arrived at the launch site on the Pegasus barge on April 27, 2021, after the successful conclusion of Green Run tests. It was moved to the VAB low bay for refurbishment and stacking preparations on April 29, 2021.[53] The stage was then stacked with its boosters on June 12, 2021. The stage adapter was stacked on the Core Stage on June 22, 2021. The ICPS upper stage was stacked on July 6, 2021. Following the completion of umbilical retract testing and integrated modal testing, the Orion stage adapter with ten secondary payloads was stacked atop the upper stage on October 8, 2021.[54]

The Artemis 1 Orion spacecraft began fueling and pre-launch servicing in the Multi-Payload Processing Facility on January 16, 2021, following a handover to NASA Exploration Ground Systems (EGS).[55][56] On October 20, 2021, the Orion spacecraft, encapsulated under the launch abort system and aerodynamic cover, was rolled over to the VAB and stacked atop the SLS rocket, finishing the stacking of the Artemis 1 vehicle in High Bay-3.[57] During a period of extensive integrated testing and checkouts, one of the four RS-25 engine controllers failed, requiring a replacement and delaying the first rollout of the rocke</p>

<p>Launch preparations

First rollout of SLS in March 2022; it was then rolled back in for repairs
On March 17, 2022, Artemis 1 rolled out of High Bay 3 from the Vehicle Assembly Building for the first time to perform a pre-launch wet dress rehearsal (WDR). The initial WDR attempt, on April 3, was scrubbed due to a mobile launcher pressurization problem.[60] A second attempt to complete the test was scrubbed on April 4, after problems with supplying gaseous nitrogen to the launch complex, liquid oxygen temperatures, and a vent valve stuck in a closed position.[61]

During preparations for a third attempt, a helium check valve on the ICPS upper stage was kept in a semi-open position by a small piece of rubber originating from one of the mobile launcher's umbilical arms, forcing test conductors to delay fueling the stage until the valve could be replaced in the VAB.[62][63] The third attempt to finish the test did not include fueling the upper stage. The rocket's liquid oxygen tank started loading successfully. However, during the loading of liquid hydrogen on the core stage, a leak was discovered on the tail service mast umbilical plate, located on the mobile launcher at the base of the rocket, forcing another early end to the test.[64][65]

NASA elected to roll the vehicle back to the VAB to repair the hydrogen leak and the ICPS helium check valve while upgrading the nitrogen supply at LC-39B after prolonged outages on the three previous wet dress rehearsals. Artemis 1 was rolled back to the VAB on April 26.[66][67][68] After the repairs and upgrades were complete the Artemis 1 vehicle rolled out to LC-39B for a second time on June 6 to complete the test.[69]

During the fourth wet dress rehearsal attempt on June 20, the rocket was fully loaded with propellant on both stages. Still, due to a hydrogen leak on the quick-disconnect connection of the tail service mast umbilical, the countdown could not reach the planned T-9.3 seconds mark and was stopped automatically at T-29 seconds. NASA mission managers soon determined they had completed almost all planned test objectives and declared the WDR campaign complete.[70]

On July 2, the Artemis 1 stack was rolled back to the VAB for final launch preparations and to fix the hydrogen leak on the quick disconnect ahead of a launch targeted in two launch windows: August 29 and September 5.[71][72] The SLS passed flight readiness review on August 23, checking out five days before the first launch opportunity.</p>
Initial launch attempts
Fueling was scheduled to commence just after midnight on August 29, 2022, but was delayed an hour due to offshore storms, only beginning at 1:13 am EDT. Before the planned launch at 8:33 am, Engine 3 of the rocket's four engines was observed to be above the maximum allowable temperature limit for launch.[74][75] Other technical difficulties involved an eleven-minute communications delay between the spacecraft and ground control, a fuel leak, and a crack on the insulating foam of the connection joints between the liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen tanks.[74][76][77] NASA scrubbed the launch after an unplanned hold and the two-hour launch window expired.[78] An investigation revealed that a sensor not used to determine launch readiness was faulty, and displayed an erroneously high temperature for Engine 3.[75]

Following the first attempt, a second launch attempt was scheduled for the afternoon of September 3.[79] The launch window would have opened at 2:17 pm EDT (18:17 UTC), and lasted for two hours.[80] The launch was scrubbed at 11:17 am EDT due to a fuel supply line leak in a service arm connecting to the engine section.[81][17] The cause of the leak was uncertain. Mission operators investigated whether an overpressurization of the liquid hydrogen line of the quick-disconnect interface during the launch attempt may have damaged a seal, allowing hydrogen to escape.[82]

Launch operators decided on the date for the next launch attempt; the earliest possible opportunity was September 19[83][84][8] until mission managers declared that September 27, and then September 30, would be the absolute earliest date, NASA having successfully repaired the leak.[85][86] A launch in September would have required that the Eastern Range of the United States Space Force agree to an extension on certification of the rocket's flight termination system, which destroys the rocket should it move off-course and towards a populated area;[82] this was carried out on September 22.[87] However, unfavorable forecasts of the trajectory of then-Tropical Storm Ian led launch managers to call off the September 27 launch attempt and begin preparations for the stack's rollback to the VAB.[88] On the morning of September 26, the decision was made to roll back later that evening.[89][90]

On November 12, following another delay due to Hurricane Nicole, NASA launch managers decided to request launch opportunities for November 16 and 19. They initially requested an opportunity for the 14th but were prevented by then-Tropical Storm Nicole.[2] As the storm approached, NASA decided to leave the rocket at the launch pad, citing a low probability that wind speeds would exceed the rocket's design limits.[91] Wind speeds were expected to reach 29 mph (47 km/h), with gusts up to 46 mph (74 km/h). Nicole made landfall as a category one hurricane on November 9, with sustained wind speeds at Kennedy Space Center reaching 85 mph (137 km/h), and gusts up to 100 mph (160 km/h), exceeding the rocket's design specifications. After the storm cleared, NASA inspected the rocket for physical damage and conducted electronic health checks.[92][93][94] On November 15, the mission management team gave a "go" to begin fully preparing for launch, and the main tanking procedures began at 3:30 pm EST (20:30 UTC).[9]
